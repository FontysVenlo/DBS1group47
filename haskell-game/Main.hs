{-|
  The 'createField' transforms a number (in this case the index of our fieldList)
  into a character. It needs the coordinates, to decide, if it is a
  dead cell "." or a living cell "o". It also cares about adding borders, if the
  cell is at the edges of the field.
  'number' is the fieldIndex
  'character' is what is printed out as a dead cell
  'rowLength' is the rowLength of the field
  'coordinates' are the positions of living cells in a 2D map
