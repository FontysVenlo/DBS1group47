# Haskell Workshop - Assignment

This Haskell Workshop is based on the the haskell workshop from two students who prepared it for the ESD course in Informatics study programme at Fontys Venlo in 2018. Thank you very much [Marco Kull](https://github.com/MarcoKull) and [Jan Evers](https://github.com/Backend-Giraffe).

## Assignment 1

- Do the assignments in [/assignments](assignments) folders.
- There are in total 6 tasks under assignments.
  - [assignments/task_0](assignments/task_0) - contains some *playing around* and *hello world* examples
  - [assignments/task_1](assignments/task_1)
  - [assignments/task_2](assignments/task_2)
  - [assignments/task_3](assignments/task_3)
  - [assignments/task_4](assignments/task_4)
  - [assignments/task_5](assignments/task_5)
- **task_0** to **task_4** are **mandatory**. You _have_ to do these and check your solutions into your github classroom repository - so this repository.
- **task_5** is **optional**

### Deadline
